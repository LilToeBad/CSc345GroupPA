KMP Algorithm:
- Searches for a pattern in a test using a table of prefixes
- Algorithm that uses the degenerating property, which makes it better for patterns with reappearing sub-patterns
- Uses previous matches to start searching the next set of characters in the text after a mismatch in order to save time
- Most important part of the KMP algorithm is the LPS (longest proper prefix that is also a suffix) table, sometimes called the Prefix table
- It is a list the length of the pattern that indicates the indices where repeat characters occur in the pattern
- The table is used when traversing the text in order to skip places where we know that characters will match
- Time complexity is O(n + m) where n is the length of the text and m is the length of the pattern due to the traversal of the text and simultaneous traversal of the LPS table
- Space usage is O(m) because an array the size of the pattern is created for the LPS table

text = "The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant
that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and
of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of a new dark age." - H.P Lovecraft's "The Call of Cthulhu"

text = "Dorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies, with Uncle Henry, who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was the farmer's wife. Their house was small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon
many miles. There were four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one room; and this room contained a rusty looking cooking stove, a cupboard for the dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and the beds. Uncle Henry and
Aunt Em had a big bed in one corner, and Dorothy a little bed in another corner. There was no garret at all, and no cellarâ€”except a small hole, dug in the ground, called a cyclone cellar, where the family could go in case
one of those great whirlwinds arose, mighty enough to crush any building in its path. It was reached by a trap-door in the middle of the floor, from which a ladder led down into the small, dark hole." - L. Frank Baum's "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"
