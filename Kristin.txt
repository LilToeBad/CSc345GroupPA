Brute force algorthim solves a problem through exhuastion. Time complexity is porportional to the input size. Simple and consistent but very slow. Iterating through every possibility available to solve the problem. 

"Brute force string matching compares a given pattern with all substrings of a given text. Those comparisons between substring and pattern proceed character by character unless a mismatch is found." - demonstrations.wolfram.com
