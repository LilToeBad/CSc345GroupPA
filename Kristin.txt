Brute force algorthim solves a problem through exhuastion. 
Iterating throughe every possibility to solve the problem. 
Time complexity is porportional to the input size. 
Simple and consistent but very slow. 
Iterating through every possibility available to solve the problem. 

"Brute force string matching compares a given pattern with all substrings of a given text. Those comparisons between substring and pattern proceed character by character unless a mismatch is found." - demonstrations.wolfram.com 

EX:
"If there is a lock of 4-digit PIN. 
The digits to be chosen from 0-9 then the brute force
will be trying all possible combinations one by one like
0001, 0002, 0003, 0004, and so on until we get the right PIN.
In the worst case, it will take 10,000 tries to find the right combination." - GeeksforGeeks

RUNTIME: O(mn).
Searching for string of "n" characters in string of "m" characters, 
it would take n* m amount of tries. 

For my function:
